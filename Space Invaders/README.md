# Space Invaders

I designed and developed a Space Invaders game, showcasing my skills in game development. The game features a classic arcade-style gameplay, complete with enemy spaceships and a player-controlled spaceship equipped with weapons. The game also includes sound effects, graphics, and scoring system for an immersive gaming experience. The Space Invaders game was created using PyGame.
