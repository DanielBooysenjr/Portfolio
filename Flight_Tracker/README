Flight Position Tracker
This is a Python script that tracks flight positions of an airline and sends an email with flight details when a flight arrives at specific airports.

Getting Started
To run this script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to install the requests and smtplib modules.

You can install the modules using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
pip install smtplib
You will also need to obtain an AviationStack API access key. You can sign up for a free account on the AviationStack website to get an access key.

Usage
To use this script, open it in a Python IDE or editor and replace the following variables with your own:

python
Copy code
avstack_api = "API KEY"
my_email = "EMAIL"
password = "PASSWORD"
The avstack_api variable should be your AviationStack API access key. The my_email and password variables should be the email address and password of the Gmail account you want to use to send the email.

You can also customize the list of target airports by modifying the target_airports variable.

python
Copy code
target_airports = ["CPT", "JNB", "PLZ", "GRJ", "KIM", "DUR", "UTN", "HLA", "ELS", "MQP", "BFN", "PRY", "PTG", "RCB", 
                   "PZB", "MGH", "PHW", "UTT", "QRA", "MBD", "AAM", "AGZ", "SZK", "VIR", "BIY", "NTY", "HDS", "ULD", 
                   "SIS", "ALJ", "ADY", "KLZ", "GCJ", "SBU", "PBZ", "ELL", "LAY", "NLP", "WEL", "HLW", "LLE", "ROD", 
                   "NCS", "OVG", "TCU"]
After modifying the variables, save the script and run it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python flight_tracker.py
The script will run and check for incoming flights at the target airports. If a flight is detected, it will save the flight details to a text file and send an email with the details as an attachment.
