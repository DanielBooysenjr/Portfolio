<h1>Flight Position Tracker</h1>
<p>This is a Python script that tracks flight positions of an airline and sends an email with flight details when a flight arrives at specific airports.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To run this script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to install the <code>requests</code> and <code>smtplib</code> modules.</p>
<p>You can install the modules using pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install requests
pip install smtplib</code></pre>
<p>You will also need to obtain an AviationStack API access key. You can sign up for a free account on the AviationStack website to get an access key.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this script, open it in a Python IDE or editor and replace the following variables with your own:</p>
<pre><code>avstack_api = "API KEY"
my_email = "EMAIL"
password = "PASSWORD"</code></pre>
<p>The <code>avstack_api</code> variable should be your AviationStack API access key. The <code>my_email</code> and <code>password</code> variables should be the email address and password of the Gmail account you want to use to send the email.</p>
<p>You can also customize the list of target airports by modifying the <code>target_airports</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code>target_airports = ["CPT", "JNB", "PLZ", "GRJ", "KIM", "DUR", "UTN", "HLA", "ELS", "MQP", "BFN", "PRY", "PTG", "RCB", 
                   "PZB", "MGH", "PHW", "UTT", "QRA", "MBD", "AAM", "AGZ", "SZK", "VIR", "BIY", "NTY", "HDS", "ULD", 
                   "SIS", "ALJ", "ADY", "KLZ", "GCJ", "SBU", "PBZ", "ELL", "LAY", "NLP", "WEL", "HLW", "LLE", "ROD", 
                   "NCS", "OVG", "TCU"]</code></pre>
<p>After modifying the variables, save the script and run it using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python flight_tracker.py</code></pre>
<p>The script will run and check for incoming flights at the target airports. If a flight is detected, it will save the flight details to a text file and send an email with the details as an attachment.</p>
