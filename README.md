## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Python Projects
- [Social Media Marketing Automation]: As a freelancer, I developed a Facebook Marketing Automation Bot to streamline a company's advertising efforts. The script automates the process of posting specific information on multiple Facebook groups, helping to save time and increase reach. The program also features a reporting module that sends email updates on the success of the campaign.

- [Website Scraping for flight detection]: Website scraping for flight location detection is a process of extracting data from airline websites to determine the location of flights. This technique involves using web scraping tools and techniques to extract data from websites and store it in a structured format. The data can then be analyzed to identify patterns and trends in flight locations, which can be used for various purposes such as predicting flight delays and optimizing travel routes.

- [Basic Game Development]: This project involves developing a simple game using Python's Turtle and Pygame libraries. The game includes basic functionalities like player movement, scoring, collision detection, and game over conditions.

- [Financial Markets Automated Trading Bot]:  designed and developed a trading algorithm using Python, showcasing my skills in financial analysis and programming. The algorithm is designed to analyze real-time market data and execute trades based on predetermined parameters. The algorithm features advanced trading strategies and risk management techniques, ensuring consistent profitability while minimizing risk. The trading algorithm was developed using Alpaca, Numpy, Tulipy, Pandas and YFinacne, and has shown impressive results.

And much more

### HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Projects
- [Personal Porfolio]: My personal portfolio is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience in various technologies. The website is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts its layout to fit any device's screen size, making it accessible to a broader audience.

The website is divided into sections, including an "About Me" section, "Skills" section, "Projects" section, and a "Contact" section. The "About Me" section contains a brief introduction of myself and my background. The "Skills" section outlines my skills in various technologies, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools. The "Projects" section displays some of my notable projects, with links to their respective repositories or live websites. Finally, the "Contact" section provides a form for visitors to contact me directly.

The website's frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, providing a modern and visually appealing design. The backend was built using the Flask framework, allowing the website to handle requests and store form data. The portfolio is hosted on a cloud server, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

Overall, my personal portfolio serves as a representation of my skills, experience, and interests in various technologies. I am open to collaboration opportunities and would be happy to discuss potential projects or employment opportunities.
