## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Python Projects
- [Social Media Marketing Automation]: Social Media Marketing Automation is a project aimed at automating marketing activities on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The project involves the development of software tools that can be used to create, schedule, and publish marketing content on these platforms automatically.

The tools would allow businesses to save time and resources by automating repetitive marketing tasks such as post scheduling, content creation, and social media account management. Additionally, the project may also involve the development of algorithms that can analyze social media data to provide insights into the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, as well as identify trends and opportunities for optimization.

Overall, the goal of Social Media Marketing Automation is to help businesses improve their social media marketing efforts and achieve better results in terms of engagement, leads, and sales.
- [Website Scraping for flight detection]: Website scraping for flight location detection is a process of extracting data from airline websites to determine the location of flights. This technique involves using web scraping tools and techniques to extract data from websites and store it in a structured format. The data can then be analyzed to identify patterns and trends in flight locations, which can be used for various purposes such as predicting flight delays and optimizing travel routes.
- [Basic Game Development]: This project involves developing a simple game using Python's Turtle and Pygame libraries. The game includes basic functionalities like player movement, scoring, collision detection, and game over conditions.

The Turtle library is used for 2D graphics and animation, while Pygame is used for audio and game controller support. These libraries provide an easy-to-use interface and allow for quick prototyping and development of simple games.

Overall, this project serves as an introduction to game development in Python and is a great starting point for those interested in learning more about the subject.

### HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Projects
- [Personal Porfolio]: My personal portfolio is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience in various technologies. The website is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts its layout to fit any device's screen size, making it accessible to a broader audience.

The website is divided into sections, including an "About Me" section, "Skills" section, "Projects" section, and a "Contact" section. The "About Me" section contains a brief introduction of myself and my background. The "Skills" section outlines my skills in various technologies, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools. The "Projects" section displays some of my notable projects, with links to their respective repositories or live websites. Finally, the "Contact" section provides a form for visitors to contact me directly.

The website's frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, providing a modern and visually appealing design. The backend was built using the Flask framework, allowing the website to handle requests and store form data. The portfolio is hosted on a cloud server, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

Overall, my personal portfolio serves as a representation of my skills, experience, and interests in various technologies. I am open to collaboration opportunities and would be happy to discuss potential projects or employment opportunities.
